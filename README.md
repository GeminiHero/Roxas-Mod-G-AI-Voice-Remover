# Roxas Mod G AI Voice Remover
 Welcome to the Roxas Mod G! A modpack of companion mods for the newly released "Roxas Mod 3.0" for Epic PC Kingdom Hearts 2! These mods aren't a part of the official release, but seek to give players even greater control over their Roxas Mod experience!

Designed for use with the OpenKH Mod Loader.

Most "new" voices in this mod are re-purposed or sentence mixed; however, a small selection of voice lines, namely the yelling of party voices by Roxas, were done using AI. I understand this is a very sensitive topic; from my perspective, we're dealing with extremely distinctive voices that don't entirely exist anymore, and the purpose of a fan work is to chase that immersion of "what-if?". While they're used in a minimally invasive way here, I know many people who have valid concerns and objections to AI voice as a whole, even in not for profit mods like this one.

To those people, I do apologize and offer this mod, which removes the AI voices in favor of more generic lines. I hope with this that you will be able to enjoy all the mod has to offer with none of that baggage ontop.
